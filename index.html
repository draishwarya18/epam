                        BTS member Jimin on Friday unveiled his first-ever solo album Face along with the music video for the title track Like Crazy. The song, Like Crazy, is a synth-pop genre that charts Jimin’s emotional singing through powerful synth and drums. Like Crazy highlights the feelings of ignoring reality and turning away from it to forget the pain.

                        The B in BTS definitely stands for brotherly bond! Always supporting each other's endevours, the boys group never fail to prove they are a family. Doing so once again, BTS' Suga paid a visit to Jimin during one of his personal schedules. As if that wasn't enough to melt your heart, let us tell you Yoongi did so to fulfill a promise he had made to Jimin almost three years ago.

                        Taking to Instagram, Suga dropped a snap with RM, J-hope, Jungkook and Jin! Yes, you read that correctly! Seems like Jin had some time off from his mandatory military duty and all the boys immediately rushed to meet the group’s eldest. While you might be wondering what about Jimin and V, Yoongi had an answer for that too.
